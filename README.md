# spotify-songs-regression
This project uses Spotify's Web API data to train supervised machine learning models to perform regression on the target variable popularity, which is a derived metric representing the popularity score of a song calculated by Spotify's Web API. 

Details on the methodology can be found in the report in the report folder. The Python source code is all located in the src folder, and the and the trained models are in the results folder, in a text file that links to a Google Drive. These need to be unzipped. The data folder contains the data, which is also zipped. All the generated figures for the report are kept in the figures folder.
